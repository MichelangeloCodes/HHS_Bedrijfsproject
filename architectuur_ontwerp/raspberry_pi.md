The turtlebot works with the ROS2 framework.
For the raspberry pi we need a base image to operate on.
So we chose Ubuntu Jammy server (22.04.5 LTS) - see link:

https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/22.04/release/

This is a server image (ARM), so it doesn't have a GUI - not needed.
The GUI uses more processing power.
