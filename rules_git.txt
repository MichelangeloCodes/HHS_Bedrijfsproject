IDENTIFY A BRANCHING STRATEGY
- Feature branching: Teams use a new branch for each feature and don't commit directly to the main branch.
- Personal branching: Similar to feature branching, but rather than develop on a branch per feature, it's per developer. Every user merges to the main branch when they complete their work.

CODE REVIEW
1) Pair programming
2) Over the shoulder reviews
3) Tool-assisted review
4) Email pass-around

benefits: sharing knowledge, discover bug earlier, maintain compliance, enhance security, increase collaboration, improve code quality

CODE REVIEW BEST PRACTISE
- limit code review sessions to keep them productive
- include everyone - including new and senior members of the team - in the process
- distribute code review request amongst the team
- ask quastions and provide helpful context
